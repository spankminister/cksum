# cksum

cksum is a quick tool to search through a file to find which subsets may match a checksum with the specified algorithm. Specifically, this tool was created to find savegame checksums within a Gamecube memory card entry with the idea that it could isolate which buffers checksummed to which values to assist in reverse engineering as a first step to fuzzing.
